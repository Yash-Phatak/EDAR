She suffered a bruising defeat to President-elect Trump on Tuesday.Pelosi told the New York Times: \"The anticipation was that, if the president were to step aside, that there would be an open primary.\"An open primary would have involved a number of Democratic candidates competing to be elected by party members to succeed Biden as their White House nominee.Pelosi argued that Harris would have done well in such a primary process and it would have made her \"stronger going forward\".\"But we don’t know that. That didn’t happen. We live with what happened,\" the California congresswoman, who was re-elected to her 20th term in the House on Tuesday, said.\"And because the president endorsed Kamala Harris immediately, that really made it almost impossible to have a primary at that time. If it had been much earlier, it would have been different.\"Results: Who did each state vote for?Democrats had bet on women showing up in force. They didn’tWhen does Trump become US president again?Speaking to political news outlet Politico, Harris aides also laid the blame at Biden’s feet and said he should have bowed out sooner.“We ran the best campaign we could, considering Joe Biden was president,” said one unnamed aide. “Joe Biden is the singular reason Kamala Harris and Democrats lost tonight.”<div

since electionHowever, a former Biden aide told Axios, another political news outlet, that Harris was making excuses.\"How did you spend $1 billion and not win?” said the aide, adding an expletive.An unnamed former Biden aide told Politico this week that former President Barack Obama’s advisers were to blame because they “publicly encouraged Democratic infighting to push Joe Biden out, didn’t even want Kamala Harris as the nominee”.Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman, a Democrat, blamed the election loss on those who plotted to oust Biden.“For those that decided and moved to break Biden, and then you got the election that you wanted, it’s appropriate to own the outcome and fallout,” he told political outlet Semafor in an interview.Congressman Tom Suozzi, New York Democratic congressman, said the election loss was partly due to the party's focus on \"being politically correct\".He said the party had struggled to counteract Republican attack lines on \"anarchy on college campuses, defund the police, biological boys playing in girls' sports, and a general attack on traditional values\".Ritchie Torres, another New York Democratic congressman, posted on X, formerly Twitter, blaming \"the far left”.He said radicals within the party had “managed to alienate historic numbers of Latinos, Blacks, Asians, and Jews from the Democratic Party with absurdities like ‘Defund the Police’ or ‘From the River to the Sea’ or ‘Latinx’”.Independent Senator Bernie Sanders, who ran for president as a Democrat in 2016 and 2020, accused the party in a lengthy statement of abandoning working people.\"While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change,\" he wrote. \"And they’re right.\"He argued Democrats probably wouldn't learn from the election outcome.But Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison responded on X that Sanders' accusation was \"straight up BS\".Related topicsUS election 2024Donald TrumpUnited

At the time of the blast, a train was ready to depart from the platform for Peshawar, reported news agency Reuters.\n\nQuetta senior superintendent of Police (SSP) operations Mohammad Baloch said the incident “seems to be a suicide blast” but it would be too early to say for sure, adding that an investigation was underway to ascertain the nature of the blast.\n\nAlso Read | Pakistan blast: Video captures moment of explosion targeting Army personnel at Quetta railway station\n\nSpeaking to reporters, SSP Baloch added that “around 100 people\" were present at the site, Dawn News reported citing footage seen by him.\n\nMohammad Baloch, a senior police officer, said the bomb exploded when passengers were waiting for a train to travel to the garrison city of Rawalpindi from Quetta, the capital of the restive Balochistan province.\n\nIn a statement, Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind said police and security forces had reached the site of the incident.\n\nShahid Rind said the nature of the blast was being investigated as the Bomb Disposal Squad was collecting evidence from the site, and a report on the incident had been sought.\n\nShahid Rind said the death toll from the attack was likely to rise as some of the wounded passengers were listed in critical condition.\n\nThe government official stated that an ‘emergency’ has been imposed in the hospitals there, adding that the “injured were being provided with medical aid,” Dawn News reported.\n\nPakistan's largest and poorest province, resource-rich Balochistan is home to separatist militants.\n\nMilitants have in the past targeted energy projects with foreign financing – most notably from China – accusing outsiders of exploiting the region while excluding residents from the profits.\n\nOne of the militant groups – the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) -- frequently claims deadly attacks against security forces or Pakistanis from other provinces, notably Punjabis.\n\nIn August, the BLA claimed responsibility for coordinated attacks by dozens of assailants who killed at least 39 people, one of the highest tolls to hit the region.",
