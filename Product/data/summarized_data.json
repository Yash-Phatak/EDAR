He was viewed as being at the heart of a clique that Gray\u2019s allies regarded as a \u201cboys\u2019 club\u201d.Tim Bale, politics professor at Queen Mary University of London, said he was unsurprised by her decision to turn down the envoy role.RecommendedPerson in the NewsSue Gray, the formidable official investigating a very British scandal \u201cIt\u2019s not as if someone with her varied experience and particular skillset won\u2019t have other opportunities,\u201d he said.Bale added that Starmer and his team would be hoping that Gray\u2019s move was not \u201ca prelude to her talking too publicly about some of what went on in Number 10 before she was replaced\u201d.The Conservatives leapt on the development, with Tory MP Richard Holden describing it as \u201ca major embarrassment\u201d for Starmer and \u201ca sign of the dysfunction at the heart of his administration\u201d."
