She\u2019s going to focus on other things,\u201d one person said.They added: \u201cShe\u2019s taken time to think about it properly, talking to stakeholders, but ultimately she\u2019s decided she doesn\u2019t want to do it.\u201dThe Guido Fawkes website, which covers Westminster news, reported on Tuesday that Number 10 had withdrawn the role. However, later on Tuesday Downing Street confirmed that Gray, after initially accepting the position, \u201chas since decided not to take up the role\u201d. Number 10 indicated it was unlikely the role would be offered to someone else, saying there were \u201cno plans\u201d for further updates on the matter.Gray stepped down as Starmer\u2019s chief of staff last month after conceding that her position risked becoming a \u201cdistraction to the government\u2019s vital work of change\u201d.Her \u00a3170,000-a-year salary had been leaked to the media amid intrigue surrounding her position in Downing Street, and stoked unease for being higher than Starmer\u2019s and because other advisers believed they had been underpaid.Some Number 10 officials denied that she was involved in special adviser contracts and insisted her role as chief of staff had made her a lightning rod for any grievances at the centre of government.She was replaced by Starmer\u2019s strategy guru Morgan McSweeney, with whom she was said to have been locked in a territorial tussle. He was viewed as being at the heart of a clique that Gray\u2019s allies regarded as a \u201cboys\u2019 club\u201d.Tim Bale, politics professor at Queen Mary University of London, said he was unsurprised by her decision to turn down the envoy role.RecommendedPerson in the NewsSue Gray, the formidable official investigating a very British scandal \u201cIt\u2019s not as if someone with her varied experience and particular skillset won\u2019t have other opportunities,\u201d he said.Bale added that Starmer and his team would be hoping that Gray\u2019s move was not \u201ca prelude to her talking too publicly about some of what went on in Number 10 before she was replaced\u201d.The Conservatives leapt on the development, with Tory MP Richard Holden describing it as \u201ca major embarrassment\u201d for Starmer and \u201ca sign of the dysfunction at the heart of his administration\u201d. He called on the prime minister to \u201ccome clean on what golden goodbye he\u2019s offered to Sue Gray\u201d.There is speculation among officials that Starmer may yet give Gray a peerage, which would allow her to contribute to the public debate on subjects she cares about, including devolution.{\"contentId\":\"7c9f4220-2a39-46ba-8216-f14641269e86\",\"annotations\":[{\"type\":\"PERSON\",\"predicate\":\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/annotation/about\",\"prefLabel\":\"Keir Starmer\",\"id\":\"139e7769-f18d-4449-8ad6-1efa992cb1c2\",\"url\":\"https://www.ft.com/stream/139e7769-f18d-4449-8ad6-1efa992cb1c2\"},{\"type\":\"ORGANISATION\",\"predicate\":\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/annotation/about\",\"prefLabel\":\"Labour party UK\",\"id\":\"b3c3674e-3dc4-49d0-a26f-2a313c8d3399\",\"url\":\"https://www.ft.com/labour-party-uk\"},{\"type\":\"ORGANISATION\",\"predicate\":\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/annotation/about\",\"prefLabel\":\"UK Government\",\"id\":\"df6c4dd6-9b8d-4400-aa69-366bbbd37e7b\",\"url\":\"https://www.ft.com/uk-government\"},{\"type\":\"PERSON\",\"predicate\":\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/annotation/about\",\"prefLabel\":\"Sue Gray\",\"id\":\"e16fa8b1-630c-4aee-a9cc-0af4f4f57789\",\"url\":\"https://www.ft.com/stream/e16fa8b1-630c-4aee-a9cc-0af4f4f57789\"},{\"type\":\"PERSON\",\"predicate\":\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/annotation/hasAuthor\",\"prefLabel\":\"Lucy Fisher\",\"id\":\"901c8e29-6390-4c3d-ac69-712987c69f4b\",\"url\":\"https://www.ft.com/lucy-fisher\"},{\"type\":\"PERSON\",\"predicate\":\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/annotation/mentions\",\"prefLabel\":\"Morgan McSweeney\",\"id\":\"1b38b2f9-5fee-4849-a287-d1a3f42ad277\",\"url\":\"https://www.ft.com/stream/1b38b2f9-5fee-4849-a287-d1a3f42ad277\"},{\"type\":\"PERSON\",\"predicate\":\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/annotation/mentions\",\"prefLabel\":\"Tim Bale\",\"id\":\"606d6036-7fce-4523-947b-f493acae5af6\",\"url\":\"https://www.ft.com/stream/606d6036-7fce-4523-947b-f493acae5af6\"},{\"type\":\"PERSON\",\"predicate\":\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/annotation/mentions\",\"prefLabel\":\"Richard Holden MP\",\"id\":\"75354ef5-abcd-4d63-ba36-0dfb54363676\",\"url\":\"https://www.ft.com/stream/75354ef5-abcd-4d63-ba36-0dfb54363676\"},{\"type\":\"ORGANISATION\",\"predicate\":\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/annotation/mentions\",\"prefLabel\":\"Financial Times\",\"id\":\"7bcfe07b-0fb1-49ce-a5fa-e51d5c01c3e0\",\"url\":\"https://www.ft.com/stream/7bcfe07b-0fb1-49ce-a5fa-e51d5c01c3e0\"},{\"type\":\"ORGANISATION\",\"predicate\":\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/annotation/mentions\",\"prefLabel\":\"Queen Mary University of London\",\"id\":\"97bab346-40a0-4b34-abbc-92ddb9afcd95\",\"url\":\"https://www.ft.com/stream/97bab346-40a0-4b34-abbc-92ddb9afcd95\"},{\"type\":\"ORGANISATION\",\"predicate\":\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/annotation/mentions\",\"prefLabel\":\"Conservative party UK\",\"id\":\"cbc34a54-9056-47c8-baa6-42d1a4cb2347\",\"url\":\"https://www.ft.com/conservative-party-uk\"},{\"type\":\"PERSON\",\"predicate\":\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/annotation/mentions\",\"prefLabel\":\"Guy Fawkes\",\"id\":\"da3e3c1a-4bf9-3a30-8291-af8054d30ce5\",\"url\":\"https://www.ft.com/stream/da3e3c1a-4bf9-3a30-8291-af8054d30ce5\"},{\"type\":\"GENRE\",\"predicate\":\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/classification/isClassifiedBy\",\"prefLabel\":\"News\",\"id\":\"a579350c-61ce-4c00-97ca-ddaa2e0cacf6\",\"url\":\"https://www.ft.com/stream/a579350c-61ce-4c00-97ca-ddaa2e0cacf6\"},{\"type\":\"ORGANISATION\",\"predicate\":\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/hasDisplayTag\",\"prefLabel\":\"UK Government\",\"id\":\"df6c4dd6-9b8d-4400-aa69-366bbbd37e7b\",\"url\":\"https://www.ft.com/uk-government\"},{\"type\":\"TOPIC\",\"predicate\":\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/implicitlyAbout\",\"prefLabel\":\"Politics\",\"id\":\"3f74186b-57e2-4dc6-b70b-5380c1c784ea\",\"url\":\"https://www.ft.com/stream/3f74186b-57e2-4dc6-b70b-5380c1c784ea\"},{\"type\":\"LOCATION\",\"predicate\":\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/implicitlyAbout\",\"prefLabel\":\"UK\",\"id\":\"6b683eff-56c3-43d9-acfc-7511d974fc01\",\"url\":\"https://www.ft.com/world-uk\"},{\"type\":\"TOPIC\",\"predicate\":\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/implicitlyAbout\",\"prefLabel\":\"World\",\"id\":\"82645c31-4426-4ef5-99c9-9df6e0940c00\",\"url\":\"https://www.ft.com/world\"},{\"type\":\"TOPIC\",\"predicate\":\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/implicitlyAbout\",\"prefLabel\":\"UK politics\",\"id\":\"9c0f3107-a34f-4319-a6a6-3101ac88b50d\",\"url\":\"https://www.ft.com/uk-politics\"}]}Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2024.

He started to lay out his reason, which was nonsensical, and disrespectful, and I wasn't having it.\"The duke said he felt furious and told his father: \"Don't ever speak about my wife that way.\" READ MORE Harry and Meghan warned they must do this to fix relations with William and Kate Stay up-to-date with the latest Royal news Join us on WhatsAppOur community members are treated to special offers, promotions, and adverts from us and our partners.

        "content": "League tables to reveal failing NHS trusts6 hours agoShareSaveMichelle RobertsDigital health editor, BBC NewsShareSavePAFailing hospitals will be revealed in league tables and NHS managers sacked if they do not turn things around, the health secretary will tell health leaders at a conference in Liverpool.Wes Streeting is promising a \"no-holds-barred, sweeping review\" of NHS performance in England. Hospitals can expect to be ranked on indicators such as care delivery and finances, so patients can see whether they are receiving a good service. And \"turnaround teams\" will be sent into struggling trusts, while top performers will have more freedom over spending.ReutersMeanwhile, senior leaders will be denied pay rises if key improvements are not made.A new pay framework for chief executives will be published in April, which will \"clamp down\" on poor performance while rewarding success. Streeting will tell the NHS Providers conference there will be \"no more turning a blind eye\" to failure - something he has promised before, along with the idea of league tables. \"We will drive the health service to improve, so patients get more out of it for what taxpayers put in,\" he will say.\u201cOur health service must attract top talent, be far more transparent to the public who pay for it, and run as efficiently as global businesses.\" 'Deep dives'The Department of Health and Social Care says, currently, there is little incentive for trusts to run budget surpluses, from which they are unable to benefit - but that will now change. Top performers will be given more capital and greater control over where to invest it - be that new equipment or technology or modernising their buildings.The NHS Oversight Framework, which sets out how trusts and integrated care boards are best monitored, will be updated to ensure performance is properly scrutinised.And at poorly performing trusts, government and NHS England \"deep dives\" will identify the most pressing issues and how they can be resolved.NHS trusts could also be banned from using expensive agency staffing to cover certain rota gaps. Some recruitment agencies have charged up to \u00a32,000 for a single nursing shift -and last year, temporary workers cost the NHS in England \u00a33bn, the government says. 'Cut waiting'NHS chief executive Amanda Pritchard welcomed the accountability, saying: \"The extensive package of reforms, developed together with government, will empower all leaders working in the NHS - and it will give them the tools they need to provide the best possible services for our patients.\"But Patients Association chief executive Rachel Power warned the new measures must bring positive change. \"We hope trusts who receive greater funding freedom will use this money wisely - to cut waiting times, make the waiting experience better for patients, and strengthen the ways they work with patients to improve services,\" she said.\"These are the things that matter most to people using the NHS.\"'Challenging circumstances'Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents NHS trusts, said health services were already subject a lot of oversight and regulation - and the prospect of \"more league tables\" would concern health leaders.\"NHS staff are doing their very best for patients, under very challenging circumstances, and we do not want them feeling like they are being named and shamed,\" he said.\"League tables in themselves do not lead to improvement.\"Mr Taylor said the \"devil will be in the detail around what constitutes failure\", much of which could be beyond a health leader's immediate control.\"We look forward to working with the government to make sure that any new measures don\u2019t disincentivise managers from taking on roles in struggling organisations,\" he said.NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts in England, said hospitals were already doing everything possible to boost productivity while delivering tough efficiency measures.HealthNHS",
